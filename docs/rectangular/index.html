        <li>We randomly generate a board. (currently 4 rows of 3 columns, but later the user should be able to configure this)</li>
        <li>Each space is either blue (user), red (computer), or gray (neutral). We start with one place belonging to the user and one belonging to the computer.</li>
        <li>The goal is to take over the whole board.</li>
        <li>The user can select one of his own places as the starting point (by pressing it) and then one of the neigbouring places by pressing on that.</li>
        <li>The computer will do the same (first in a random way and then with an algorithm)</li>
        <li>The player presses "Next" and we compute the next status. </li>
        <li>TOPLAN: I am not yet sure how do we decide the status of the next stage.</li>
